### Latest news:

#####**11/16/2016:**
Reached my 150$ hard cap for the month in the cloud. Services will resume next billing period (next week).

#####**10/20/2016:**

~~Moving infrastructure away from DigialOcean/OVH to Azure. Expect some downtime!~~

The move didn't go as smooth as I had planned, and I was forced to roll out version 2.0 early. The old cloud code wasn't handling the 100s of connections from my monitoring suite.

Everyone's lights probably went a little crazy -- sorry about that. I'll remember for next time.

Users: I've made endpoint changes to the SmartThings app. You'll need to edit the line, or do a Git pull from the UI to update.

File: smartapps/cloudsyjared/milight-manager.src/milight-manager.groovy

Line 84: ```uri:  'https://lights.cloudsy.com/v1/',```

Needs to be changed to:

```uri:  'https://api.mithings.pw/v1/'```

There is a new cloud server endpoint, please update your hubs:

**TCP,38899,cloud.mithings.pw**

Issues? Post them on Github.

#####**05/13/2016:**

Introducing breaking changes to the cloud API, all users must update. Infrastructure has been fully changed and is now in a self healing docker host.
